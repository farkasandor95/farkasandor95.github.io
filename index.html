	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<h2>My name is Andor Farkas, and this is my portfolio.</h2>

		<p>
			I have been a Unity developer for 5 years. In the last semester of uni I worked as an Intern at Mozaik Education, where I started my career as a Unity Developer after graduating in 2018.
		</p>
		<p>
			During my years (2018-2022) at Mozaik Education I participated in various projects:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Development and maintenance of <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rendernet.mozaik3dviewer">mozaik3D Android application</a>, which led me to collaborate with overseas partner <a target="_blank" href="https://www.leiainc.com/newsroom/leia-inc-partners-with-mozaik-education-to-bring-more-immersive-learning-to-its-lume-pad">Leia Inc.</a> and also to port the base application to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5873610999369808/">Meta Quest devices</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Porting the <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mozaweb.cadaveranatomy">cadaVR anatomy application to Android devices</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				VR training software for electic car mechanics
			</li>
			<li>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mozaweb.com/Extra-3D_scenes-Tyrannosaurus_rex_tyrant_lizard-170423">Minigame where you avoid meteorites as a cute T-rex</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://moramuzeum.hu/en/travel-to-the-past-permanent-historical-exhibition-of-szeged-castle-museum/">Collaboration with MÃ³ra Ferenc Museum</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Work with editors making digital web lessons
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I had the pleasure of working with people of various skills: content creators, 2D/3D graphic designers, UI/UX designers, translators and - of course - my fellow developers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since then I have been focusing on improving my skills in both Unity and .Net development. You can find some of my projects on this website.

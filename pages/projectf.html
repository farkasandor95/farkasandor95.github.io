	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			Project F is a turn-based Match3 roguelite game in a colosseum setup. Every turn the player gets 5 moves in the Match3 grid, where every cell contributes energy to one of the 5 types: Non-Elemental, Fire, Water, Earth, Air. After these 5 moves, the player will select their character(s)' actions: Attack, Skill, Defend, Item. Once the actions have been selected, the combat-phase begins. First the playeractions are performed, then the enemyactions. The game then returns to the Match3 grid. This repeats until either the playercharacters or the enemies are defeated. If the player won the combat, they will proceed to a different screen featuring rewards, then onto the next battle. If the player lost, the game will restart.
